HEY THERE,

How to start:
* first create a project, 
* name the project, 
* activate an environtment, I would prefere virtual environment,
* go to terminal copy the repository and paste it in terminal, wheather its pycharm or MacOS terminal.
* install the requirements (requirements.txt): pip3 install -r requirements.txt
* or you can directly install requirements: pip3 install pyqt5


Files Introduction:
EasyMove.py is the main py file where I coded interface and backend code,
EasyMoveIcon.png is used as icon,
setup.py is where we can build macOS app using py2app,
Manipulate.py is only interface, you can modify it for practice purpose, or used it for real project (whatever you do with it, as your wish),


Note:
py2app is only used for MacOS Apps building
for windows use pyinstaller or py2exe
